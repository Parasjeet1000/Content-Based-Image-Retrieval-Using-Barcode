# Content-Based-Image-Retrieval-Using-Barcode

a pool of  100 images in order to create a search algorithm. This algorithm will ask us to provide a picture from the pool and it will then run through the other 99 images and find the images that are the most similar to the input image. The retrieval accuracy for this algorithm was 82%; algorithms with such complexities will never reach a 100% level of accuracy


Barcode Generation Instructions:

1. Place desired image into the Generate folder, and rename it to generate.jpg
2. Run generate.py


Search Instructions:
1. Place query image into the Search folder, and rename it to search.jpg.
2 (Optional). Remove query image from MNIST_DS.
3. Run search.py
